=Overview==

The aim of TPTeam is to create an exemplary collaborative testing tool by using the [http://eclipse.org/equinox Eclipse Equinox] and [http://eclipse.org/ecf Communication Framework (ECF)] projects.This goal will be achieved by the development of three components: TPBuddy, a rich GUI client; TPBridge, an event-driven bundle that bridges communication across JVMs; and TPManager, a test management bundle. All three components will utilize novel service-oriented architecture components derived from Equinox and distributed events to achieve collaborative unit testing. The proposed work represents a practical first step in utilizing newly available Eclipse open source projects for the creation of collaborative tools.

TPTeam allows users distributed across the enterprise network to collaboratively manage software projects while executing tests and being alerted to results in real-time. It provides a GUI with built-in functionality for group chatting and project management. "Dashboard" views provide real-time statistical updates on a test project's state and progress. TPTeam is extensible: other Eclipse plugins can be added to integrate requirements, build, and issue management in a collaborative fashion.
